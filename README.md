            = Add exercises to the most recent workout plan. [ ]

            - Add new exercises to a new workout plan. [ ]

            - View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page. [ ]

            - View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.[ ]
